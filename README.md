# Firebase SDK Multiple Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: calling `initializeApp` multiple times with different configurations. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and errors in your application.

The `multipleInitBug.js` file shows the erroneous code where Firebase is initialized twice with different configurations. The `multipleInitSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that initializes Firebase only once using a proper configuration.

This issue is relevant to developers using the Firebase JavaScript SDK and can lead to frustrating debugging experiences. This example helps understand and avoid this error.

## Solution

Ensure that the `initializeApp` method is called only once, using the correct and consistent configuration object. Use a method to ensure that the initialization is performed only once, regardless of how many times the code tries to perform it. Consider using a singleton pattern or a flag to prevent multiple initializations.
