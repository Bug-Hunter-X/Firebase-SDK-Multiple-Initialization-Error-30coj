To fix this issue, ensure that `initializeApp` is called only once throughout the application's lifecycle.  You might need to refactor your code to centralize Firebase initialization. One approach is to initialize Firebase in your application's main entry point (e.g., in your `index.js` or `App.js` file) and make the Firebase app instance available to other parts of your application.

```javascript
// multipleInitSolution.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";

const firebaseConfig = {
  //Your Firebase Config
};

let app;

function initializeFirebase(){
    if(!app){
        app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    }
    return app;
}

const firebaseApp = initializeFirebase();

// ... rest of your code using firebaseApp ...
```
